What I learned about Python:
I learned how to define functions, use loops, and work with lists to solve problems like generating Fibonacci numbers. Pythonâ€™s syntax is simple and readable, making it easy to implement algorithms and debug code.

Any errors or difficulties:
I encountered some difficulties with off-by-one errors when generating sequences and sometimes forgot to handle edge cases, such as when n is zero or negative. Debugging these issues helped me understand the importance of testing and validating input.

What Git commands you used:
I used git init to initialize a new repository, git add to stage changes, and git commit to save my work with descriptive messages. These commands helped me track changes and manage my code versions efficiently.
